Idea:
Given internet-sourced time of arrival for a particular bus, our app will suggest a departure time. Time to get to the bus stop will be kept constant, in a setting. Every suggestion will be followed with a feedback question: too early, too late, or perfect. Our app will gradually adjust suggestions until they are perfect 95% of the time.
